## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a Front-End Engineer with 10+ years of professional experience, currently transitioning into a **DevOps Engineer** role.

I am now actively building hands-on DevOps projects and strengthening my skills in real-world DevOps tools and workflows.

My goal is to design, deploy, and automate scalable, reliable, and secure systems.

# Hi 👋, I'm Puneet Bansal from India 🇮🇳

Front-End Engineer transitioning into DevOps 🚀  
Cloud • Kubernetes • CI/CD • Automation

---

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m someone who thrives on challenges and continuous growth, and my career journey reflects that mindset.

After spending **8 years in the banking domain (operations)**, I pivoted toward my passion for technology and transitioned into IT in **2023**. Since then, I’ve been building my skills hands-on and growing every day.

Currently, I work as a **UI Engineer**, creating responsive and user-friendly web interfaces using **React and Typescript**. While front-end development strengthened my understanding of application behavior, performance, and user experience, my long-term goal is to **transition into a DevOps Engineer role**.

Over time, I’ve developed a strong interest in **DevOps practices, automation, and cloud-native technologies**. I actively practice and build real-world experience with:

- Linux & Shell Scripting  
- Git & CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins, GitLab CI)  
- Docker & Kubernetes  
- Cloud fundamentals (AWS)  
- Infrastructure concepts, monitoring, and deployment automation  

My background in **operations** and **application development** allows me to bridge the gap between development and infrastructure—understanding both how applications are built and how they should be **deployed, scaled, and maintained reliably**.

## 🚀 What I’m Working On

- Building end-to-end **DevOps projects**
- Deploying applications on **Kubernetes**
- Automating **CI/CD pipelines**
- Strengthening **AWS & Terraform fundamentals**
- Practicing real-world DevOps scenarios daily
